The data consists of various documents such as curriculum, institutional identity, and objectives, which do not contain a list of full-time faculty members.\n\nHowever, if we analyze the data, we can identify some relevant points:\n\n1. The curriculum documents (e.g., BSCS, BSIN) mention courses offered by different departments (e.g., CTE, CON).\n2. The institutional identity documents (e.g., mission and vision statement) do not explicitly mention full-time faculty members.\n3. There are no other documents that directly provide information on full-time faculty members.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, it is not possible to determine who the full-time faculty members are."
